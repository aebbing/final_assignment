        <h1>Our challenges</h1>

        <p> My first experience with coding was quite good. I thought 
            it was very fun to be able to make whatever you want and make it the way you want. It´s like endless 
            opportunities and almost no limits. I found that very interesting. On the other hand, did I also find 
            out that coding is not easy, and takes a lot of time and mastering. One little typo can make your entire 
            program stop, and you must work smart and concentrated. </p>

        <p> Until now, I have learned to code html/css and some Java. I think it´s fun, but at the same time a bit 
            complicated. The main issues I had while learning this for the first time was mostly understanding when to 
            do this and when to do that. For example in Java, when to use different classes and when to put them 
            as private or public etc. In web design, some of my biggest issues while learning this for the first time 
            was how to make the website look the way you want it to be, and how to stick to the plan you made before starting. 
            Also, the styling of the page was quite challenging when you´d be totally new to coding. These are things that become more 
            natural with time and experience, but in the beginning was extremely challenging. </p>
