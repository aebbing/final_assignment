    <h1>Our challenges</h1>

    <p> My first experience with coding was quite good. I thought
      it was very fun to be able to make whatever you want and make it the way you want. It´s like endless
      opportunities and almost no limits. I found that very interesting. On the other hand, did I also find
      out that coding is not easy, and takes a lot of time and mastering. One little typo can make your entire
      program stop, and you must work smart and concentrated. </p>

    <p> Until now, I have learned to code html/css and some Java. I think it´s fun, but at the same time a bit
      complicated. The main issues I had while learning this for the first time was mostly understanding when to
      do this and when to do that. For example in Java, when to use different classes and when to put them
      as private or public etc. In web design, some of my biggest issues while learning this for the first time
      was how to make the website look the way you want it to be, and how to stick to the plan you made before starting.
      Also, the styling of the page was quite challenging when you´d be totally new to coding. These are things that
      become more
      natural with time and experience, but in the beginning was extremely challenging. </p>

        <h2>Managing the workload</h2> <!-- topic c) under reflection essay on the task sheet -->
    <p>One of the main challenges for a lot of students this semester has been to manage the workload. As well as
      following the regular programme for software engineering and other programmes within IT, a lot of us had to do
      highschool maths and physics at the same time, since we didn’t study it while in school. This despite the fact
      that engineering studies and other STEM-programmes can be challenging enough by themselves, especially in the
      first year when a lot of students find themselves being met with entirely different workloads and expectations
      when transitioning from highschool.</p>

    <p>However, there are also students who find themselves transitioning from the workforce, which can also be
      challenging. A lot of us also find ourselves remaining in the workforce, or entering it, while studying full-time.
      In this case we are talking about an entirely different kind of workload, which might restrict you in a lot of
      things that require time, e.g. hobbies and socialising. A lot of people might find themselves in this situation
      due to financial stress, e.g. they don’t want/cannot afford a student loan, and/or don’t want/don’t have the
      opportunity to get help from their families. Even though it might be tough to balance such an enormous workload, a
      lot of people working on the side might find themselves in a more secure financial position, which in turn offers
      more freedom.</p>
