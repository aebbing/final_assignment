      <h1>ACCESSIBILITY</h1>

      <p>This page describes our thinking process, and what tips we got from the automated accessibility test.</p>

      <p>We tried different things to get accessibility using different tests online. For example, we used
        https://color.a11y.com/ to check the colour contrast of our webpage.</p>

      <p>We also made some universal coding-choices such as we add aria-labelledby attribute in navigation bar for
        accessibility. We chose aria-labelledby with label tag to increase compatibility cross web browsers.</p>

      <p> For small screens we preferred to use :active selector instead :hover selector to make it easier to which page
        is loaded. For larger screens we used :hover selector to make navigation bar items glow and more visible for
        users, and underline on navigation bar list items to see where they are on the website. </p>

      <!--<p>For the smaller screens we gathered the menu items in the navigation bar in a hamburger menu, in order to
        prevent said menu items from stacking on top of each other when the screen width becomes too small. There was,
        however, an issue in this regard. A screenreader would have simply ignored the three bar icon, and it was
        impossible to select the icon with the keyboard, which would have robbed screenreader users of the possibility
        to navigate the website. While researching ways to solve this problem, using JavaScript was presented as a
        possible solution. However, we arrived at the decision of unhiding the checkbox connected to the icon and adding
        an aria-label, so that the screenreader would be able to catch it and allowing users to open it by tapping the
        space bar. At the same time we reduced the checkbox' size and opacity, thus making it invisible to other users.
      </p>-->

      <p>For easy readability we created a container to add a background colour. We also added text shadows to the text
        to make it clearer. We also used calc() fonts to make text size bigger if the page is zoomed. </p>

      </p> We used W3C CSS validation and html validation for all the pages and found some errors. </p>
