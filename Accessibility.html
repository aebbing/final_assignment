      <h1 id="accessibility">ACCESSIBILITY</h1>

      <p>This page describes our thinking process, and what tips we got from the automated accessibility test.</p>

      <p>We tried different things to get accessibility using different tests online. For example, we used
        color contrast accessibility validator to check the colour contrast of our webpage. The colour-checker 
        told us that the contrast between the background-colour and the text-colour should be higher. We fixed 
        this issue to make the visibility of the text clearer for everybody. For easy readability we created a 
        container to add a background colour. We also added text shadows to the text to make it clearer. We also 
        used calc() fonts with vw units to make text size bigger if the page is zoomed.  </p>

      <p>We used aria-labelledby attribute in navigation bar for accessibility. It also increases compatibility 
        cross web browsers which assures us that code will run on different platforms. We tried our best to maintain 
        the semantic structure of the page for example we use nav tag for navigation bar rather than use div tag and 
        use class as nav. We also used unordered list and h2 tag in navigation bar to increase accessibility 
        specially for screenreader users. For better performance of aria-labelledby attributes we needed h2 tag rather 
        than p tag. This way they can identify the structure of the page easily.  </p>

      <p>We made sure there is only one h1 tag in main section for screenreader users. Headings levels were used 
        properly from h1 to h6 where there were more headings. We also avoid using br tag to break paragraphs and 
        headings to gain maximum accessibility for everyone. 
      </p>

      <p> For small screens we preferred to use :active selector instead of :hover selector to make it easier to which 
        page is loaded. For larger screens we used :hover selector to make navigation bar items glow and more visible 
        for users, and underline on navigation bar list items to see where they are on the website.  </p>

      <p>For the smaller screens we used the hamburger menu in the navigation bar to prevent list items from stacking 
        on top of each other when the screen width becomes smaller. There was an issue regarding this. A screenreader 
        would have simply ignored the three-bar icon, and it was also impossible to select the icon with keyboard. It 
        was risking our websiteâ€™s accessibility so we found a solution of unhiding the checkbox connected to the icon
        and adding an aria-label, so that the screenreader would be able to catch it and allowing users to open it by 
        tapping the space bar to navigate the website. At the same time, we reduced the checkbox size and opacity, 
        thus making it invisible to other users.  </p>

      <p id="lastP"> We used W3C CSS validation and html validation for all the pages and found some errors. There were errors 
       for example missing id for aria labelledby attribute. We add the id to the nav bar to fix this. We also removed 
       some unnecessary tags and fixed syntax of code. </p>
