    <h1>ACCESSIBILITY</h1>
    
    <p>This page describes our thinking process, and what tips we got from the automated accessibility test.</p>

    <p>We tried different things to get accessibility using different tests online. For example, we used https://color.a11y.com/ to 
      check the colour contrast of our webpage.</p> 

    <p>We also made some universal coding-choices such as we add aria-labelledby attribute in navigation bar for accessibility. 
      We chose aria-labelledby with label tag to increase compatibility cross web browsers. We made sure we are using only one 
      h1 tag for screenreader users. Headings levels were used properly from h1 to h6 where there were more headings. </p>

    <p> For small screens we preferred to use :active selector instead :hover selector to make it easier to which page is loaded. 
      For larger screens we used :hover selector to make navigation bar items glow and more visible for users, and underline on 
      navigation bar list items to see where they are on the website. </p>

    <p>For easy readability we created a container to add a background colour. We also added text shadows to the text to make it 
      clearer.  We also used calc() fonts to make text size bigger if the page is zoomed. </p>

    <p> We used W3C CSS validation and html validation for all the pages and found some errors. There were errors for example 
      missing id for aria labelledby attribute. We add the id to the nav bar to fix this. We also removed some unnecessary tags and 
      fixed syntax of code.  </p>
