      <h1>ACCESSIBILITY</h1>

      <p>This page describes our thinking process, and what tips we got from the automated accessibility test.</p>

      <p>We tried different things to get accessibility using different tests online. For example, we used
        https://color.a11y.com/ to check the colour contrast of our webpage.</p>

      <p>We also made some universal coding-choices such as we add aria-labelledby attribute in navigation bar 
        for accessibility. We chose aria-labelledby with label tag to increase compatibility cross web browsers. 
        We made sure we are using only one h1 tag for screenreader users. Headings levels were used properly 
        from h1 to h6 where there were more headings. We also avoid using br tag to break paragraphs and headings 
        to gain maximum accessibility. </p>

      <p> For small screens we preferred to use :active selector instead :hover selector to make it easier to which 
        page is loaded. For larger screens we used :hover selector to make navigation bar items glow and more visible 
        for users, and underline on navigation bar list items to see where they are on the website.  </p>

      <p>For the smaller screens we used the hamburger menu in the navigation bar to prevent list items from stacking 
        on top of each other when the screen width becomes smaller. There was an issue regarding this. A screenreader 
        would have simply ignored the three-bar icon, and it was also impossible to select the icon with keyboard. It 
        was risking our websiteâ€™s accessibility so we found a solution of unhiding the checkbox connected to the icon
        and adding an aria-label, so that the screenreader would be able to catch it and allowing users to open it by 
        tapping the space bar to navigate the website. At the same time, we reduced the checkbox size and opacity, 
        thus making it invisible to other users.  </p>

      <p>For easy readability we created a container to add a background colour. We also added text shadows to the text 
        to make it clearer.  We also used calc() fonts to make text size bigger if the page is zoomed.  </p>

      </p> We used W3C CSS validation and html validation for all the pages and found some errors. There were errors 
       for example missing id for aria labelledby attribute. We add the id to the nav bar to fix this. We also removed 
       some unnecessary tags and fixed syntax of code.  </p>
