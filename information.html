            <p>Algorithms register what we search for, what websites we visit, which items we buy, the videos we watch,
                the posts we like, etc. This information is often used to provide targeted ads to make us buy something
                and/or recommendations to make us stay on the site for longer, which might translate into revenue
                through direct sales or ad space. Algorithms are also used to sort emails, as well as in translation
                software. These are perhaps some of their most well-known uses. What a lot of people might not be aware
                of, however, is that algorithms are also used to write certain types of texts, especially the kind that
                typically follows a certain template, like sports columns, 
                <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/04/can-an-algorithm-write-a-better-news-story-than-a-human-reporter/"
                target="_blank">which you can read more about in this article by the Wired</a>. For the past couple
                of years theyâ€™ve also
                been tested for driving vehicles (link needed).</p>

            <p>However, despite their obvious advantages in a lot of respects, algorithms have also been known to
                contribute to the spread of right-wing extremism on video sharing platforms and social media. Read more 
                about this in <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/is_social_media_driving_political_polarization" 
                target="_blank"> this piece published by Greater Good Magazine </a>. This is not necessarily done intentionally on the developers' part, 
                but comes as a result of how the algorithms themselves work - they want to serve you content that is similar to the kind 
                you've engaged with before. Nevertheless, algorithms are indeed also used in much more deliberate, ill-intentioned ways, which
                should invoke worry.</p>

            <p>Algorithms are used to track your movements, e.g. through dating and running apps, potentially compromising 
                the security of sexual minorities (<a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/05/grindr-promises-privacy-still-leaks-exact-location/" 
                target="_blank"> The Wired: Gay Dating Apps Promise Privacy, But Leak Your Exact Location</a>) and military forces 
                (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42853072" target="_blank">BBC: Fitness app Strava lights up staff at military bases</a>),
                respectively. They are also used to record unwitting smartphone users, which you can read more about in <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/smartphone-devices-recording-privacy_l_5d570869e4b056fafd0bbc09" 
                target="_blank"> this article by the Huffington Post</a>. Algorithms are also used in facial recognition software, the kind that is
                used in smartphones that allow you to unlock the screen by holding the device in front of you. Though
                that by itself might seem quite innocent, such software can be implemented on a massive scale. In fact,
                it has been used for several years already. In Moscow, facial recognition software was implemented in
                public surveillance in 2017, and has led to the <a href="https://www.interfax.ru/moscow/770999" target="_blank">arrest of over 1 600 people on public transport in less
                than a year according to Interfax (article in Russian)</a>. Critics have voiced concern regarding how this system might be abused in the future in an
                increasingly authoritarian Russian state, e.g. by following the most extreme example so far - the social
                credit system in China.</p>

            <p>So even though algorithms can be very useful, the exploitation of them as illustrated above is alarming,
                and clearly shows that more discussion and regulation around these questions are needed.</p>

                Technology and society are deeply connected. Technologies shapes societies and societies affect
                Technologies. While making technological decisions we need to analyse its effects deeply. For example this phrase
                "The person who invented the train invented the train crash." makes us think about the
                societal responsibility of innovators. To know more about this read <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/journal/issue-2/love-your-monsters" target="_blank">
                Love Your Monsters</a>. This artciles have some good points regarding technology and responsibility.
