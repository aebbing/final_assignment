            <p>Algorithms register what we search for, what websites we visit, which items we buy, the videos we watch,
               the posts we like, etc. This information is often used to provide targeted ads to make us buy something
               and/or recommendations to make us stay on the site for longer, which might translate into revenue
               through direct sales or ad space. Algorithms are also used to sort emails, as well as in translation
               software. These are perhaps some of their most well-known uses. What a lot of people might not be aware
               of, however, is that algorithms are also used to write certain types of texts, especially the kind that
               typically follows a certain template, like sports columnsi. For the past couple of years theyâ€™ve also
               been tested for driving vehicles (link needed).</p>

            <p>However, despite their obvious advantages in a lot of respects, algorithms have also been known to
                contribute to the spread of right-wing extremism on video sharing platforms and social mediaii. This is
                not necessarily done intentionally on the developers' part, but comes as a result of how the algorithms
                themselves work - they want to serve you content that is similar to the kind you've engaged with before.
                Nevertheless, algorithms are indeed also used in much more deliberate, ill-intentioned ways, which
                should invoke worry.</p>

            <p>Algorithms are used to track your movements, e.g. through datingiii and running appsiv, potentially
                compromising the security of sexual minorities and military forces. They are also used to record
                unwitting smartphone usersv. Algorithms are also used in facial recognition software, the kind that is
                used in smartphones that allow you to unlock the screen by holding the device in front of you. Though
                that by itself might seem quite innocent, such software can be implemented on a massive scale. In fact,
                it has been used for several years already. In Moscow, facial recognition software was implemented in
                public surveillance in 2017, and has led to the arrest of over 1 600 people on public transport in less
                than a yearvi. Critics have voiced concern regarding how this system might be abused in the future in an
                increasingly authoritarian Russian state, e.g. by following the most extreme example so far - the social
                credit system in China.</p>

            <p>So even though algorithms can be very useful, the exploitation of them as illustrated above is alarming,
                and clearly shows that more discussion and regulation around these questions are needed.</p>

                Technology and society are deeply connected. Technologies shapes societies and societies affect Technologies.
                While making technological decisions we need to analyse many its effects deeply. For example this phrase 
                "The person who invented the train invented the train crash." makes us think about the
                societal responsibility of innovators. To read more about this <a href="">link to that article</a>
